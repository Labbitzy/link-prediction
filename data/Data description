# Data Description
The training network is a fragment of an academic co-authorship graph. The nodes in the network—authors— have been given randomly assigned IDs, and an undirected edge between node A and B represents that authors A and B have published a paper together as co-authors. The training network is a network of a time period (2010-2017), focusing on individuals in a specific academic sub-community.
## train.txt
txt file containing training graph data  in a (tab delimited) edge list format, where each row represents a node and its neighbors. For example:
1 2 
2 1  3  4 
3 2  5 
4 2  5 
5 3  4
## nodes.json
JSON file including several features of the nodes (authors).
 • their id in the graph 
 • the number of years since their first and last publication to 2017 (e.g. first:3 means author published first paper at 2014) 
 • their number of publications in total, num_papers 
 • presence of specific keywords in the titles and abstracts of their publications (denoted keyword_X where X ∈ {0, 1,..., 53}, each being a binary value and only listed if its value is 1) 
 • publication at specific venues (denoted venue_X where X ∈ {0, 1,..., 303}, each being a binary value and only listed if its value is 1)
## dev.csv & dev-labels.csv
The development set is a list of 4,866 edges, contain 2,433 real edges in the year after the time period of the training set (2018) , and also 2,433 fake edges (pairs of nodes that are not connected).
